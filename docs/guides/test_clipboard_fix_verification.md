# Clipboard Fix Verification Test

## Test Case 1: Verify No Automatic Clipboard Modification
**Steps:**
1. Open the app and navigate to Settings
2. Tap on "API Key管理" preference
3. Observe that the API Key management dialog opens

**Expected Result:**
- Dialog opens without any automatic clipboard modification
- No toast messages about clipboard operations appear
- User's clipboard content remains unchanged

## Test Case 2: Verify Manual Clipboard Copy Works
**Steps:**
1. Open API Key management dialog
2. Select "复制后台地址" (Copy backend address) option
3. Check clipboard content

**Expected Result:**
- If device IP is available: Clipboard contains "http://[IP]:[PORT]/[API_KEY]"
- If device IP is not available: Clipboard contains just the API Key
- Appropriate toast message is displayed
- Function executes only once per user selection

## Test Case 3: Verify Error Handling
**Steps:**
1. Test on a device/emulator with restricted clipboard access
2. Try to copy backend address

**Expected Result:**
- SecurityException is caught and logged
- User sees "无法访问剪贴板" error message
- App doesn't crash

## Test Case 4: Verify Function Call Frequency
**Steps:**
1. Open API Key management dialog multiple times
2. Select "复制后台地址" option each time
3. Monitor clipboard and toast messages

**Expected Result:**
- Function only executes when user explicitly selects the option
- No duplicate or automatic executions
- Each selection results in exactly one clipboard operation

## Code Changes Made:
1. Removed duplicate clipboard service initialization lines
2. Added proper try-catch error handling for SecurityException
3. Added comprehensive error handling with user feedback
4. Maintained single clipboard service instance per function call
5. Added proper logging with Timber for debugging

## Requirements Satisfied:
- ✅ 1.1: No automatic clipboard modification when dialog opens
- ✅ 1.2: Function executes only once per user selection
- ✅ 1.3: Proper error handling and user feedback for clipboard operations
